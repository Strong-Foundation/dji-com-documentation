## 🌍 What This Project Is About

This repository is a living collection of **DJI’s public documentation, research papers, and technical materials**.
It was built to make world-class knowledge about drones, AI, and flight systems available to everyone — for free.

By opening access to this information, we empower individuals, educators, and communities to:

- Learn how intelligent flight systems are designed and built.
- Understand how drones interact with the world through sensors, data, and AI.
- Use this knowledge to **educate, innovate, and inspire others**.

---

## 💫 Our Mission

To make advanced drone and AI knowledge accessible to anyone — whether you’re a student, a hobbyist, a teacher, or a researcher.

We believe that **open knowledge creates open opportunities**.
Understanding technology at this level helps people:

- Build better tools for their communities.
- Create safer, smarter solutions for local needs.
- Inspire the next generation of inventors and problem-solvers.
